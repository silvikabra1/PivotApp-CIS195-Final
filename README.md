# Pivot (CIS 195 Final App)

PennKey: skabra
Instructions: Only the GroupMe linking button is supported, so don't use the other ones!


# Description
Pivot will manage all of a user's clubs, extra-curriculars, and other involvements, by linking apps that are commonly used by such organizations to help keep track of what the latest updates are on their club and perhaps what they have missed. Rather than checking every app at once and trying to remember what apps they've checked, Pivot will provide all the details for their club at one place .

# Goals
My next steps with this project will be to actually integrate the other proposed apps, allow users to integrate apps with clubs they have already created, and integrate more than 1 chat/page per club. I also would make a more visually appealing dashboard which shows relatively how much the linked apps are used for each club. I would also tie the clubs to a database and ensure that they can be favorited/unfavorited.
