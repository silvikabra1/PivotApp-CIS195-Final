# Pivot (CIS 195 Final App)

PennKey: skabra
Instructions: Only the GroupMe linking button is supported, so don't use the other ones!


# Description
Pivot will manage all of a user's clubs, extra-curriculars, and other involvements, by linking apps that are commonly used by such organizations to help keep track of what the latest updates are on their club and perhaps what they have missed. Rather than checking every app at once and trying to remember what apps they've checked, Pivot will provide all the details for their club at one place .
# Goals
I want to actually integrate the other proposed apps, and also allow users to integrate even after creating a club and integrate more than 1 group/page per club. I also want to make a more visual dashboard which shows relatively how much the linked apps are used for the club. I also want to make sure the clubs are tied to a database and can be favorited/unfavorited.
